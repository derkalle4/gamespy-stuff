Welcome to GameMaster, our alternative masterserver for gamespy. We provide you the source code to help us improving gamemaster to create an even better experience. We also got a lot of help by other people. Sorry that I cannot name anyone of them any more because our active developing phase is a long time ago. But thanks to everyone who helped us :)

This repository contains all the stuff we found and needed to reverse engineer the gamespy masterserver :)
